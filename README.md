# Desktop 3D scanner
This repository contains MATLAB code to scan objects in 3D using a turntable, a
laser line and a conventional webcam. The turntable is controlled using a step
motor by an Arduino microcontroller board.

## Camera calibration
Explanation about camera calibration goes here.

## Relative pose calibration
How is the position of the laser with respect to the camera obtained.

## Tabletop calibration
How do we locate the table plane and rotation axis.
